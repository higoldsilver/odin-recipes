            <figcaption>This Italian meatball recipe is very easy to make, and since we skip the messy step of pan-frying the meatballs, it becomes downright simple. Here I use a standard half-beef/half-pork mixture. Once the meatballs are baked, add them to your favorite prepared tomato sauce and simmer for 1 to 2 hours.</figcaption>

       <p><h2>Ingredients</h2></p>
       <ul>
            <li><strong>Bread crumbs</strong>: Use store-bought bread crumbs or make your own at home. </li>
            <li><strong>Milk</strong>: Milk adds moisture, ensuring the meatballs don’t dry out during the cooking process. </li>
            <li><strong>Onion</strong>: An onion lends bold flavor. </li>
            <li><strong>Meat</strong>: You’ll need a pound of ground beef and a pound of ground pork. </li>
            <li><strong>Egg</strong>: An egg adds moisture and helps bind the meatballs together. </li>
            <li><strong>Cheese</strong>: For the most delicious results, grate your own Parmesan cheese.</li>
            <li> <strong>Seasonings</strong>: The meatballs are seasoned with fresh parsley, garlic, salt, black pepper, dried Italian herb seasoning, and red pepper flakes.</li>
       </ul>
       <p><h2>Steps</h2></p>
       <ol>
            <li>Cover a baking sheet with foil and spray lightly with cooking spray. Soak bread crumbs in milk in a small bowl for 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add onion; cook and stir until onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to low and continue cooking and stirring until onion is very tender, about 15 minutes more.</li>
            <li>Gently stir beef and pork together in a large bowl. Add onions, bread crumb mixture, eggs, Parmesan cheese, parsley, garlic, salt, black pepper, Italian herb seasoning, and red pepper flakes; mix together using a rubber spatula until combined. Cover and refrigerate for about one hour.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Form mixture into balls about 1 1/2 inches in diameter; arrange in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until browned and cooked through, 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
       </ol>
